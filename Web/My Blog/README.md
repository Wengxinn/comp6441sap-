## Solutions
### Step 1: 
I first clicked the link attached in the question. The link brought me to a blog page as shown below:

### Step 2: 
This challenge was a quick one because the hint was quite obvious. 

First, I examine the website by right-clicking it, then I selected ```Inspect```. 

Note that in the question, it is stated that ```'you may find a good application for your memory'```. This means that the flag was hidden in somewhere ```Application``` - ```Storage``` - ```Local Storage``` section because memory also refers to the local storage.

### Step 3: 
As we can see in the picture, the flag is there!
