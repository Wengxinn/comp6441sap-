## Solutions
### Step 1:
First, I downloaded the ```.wav``` file and renamed it as ```tone dialing - task.wav```. 

### Step 2: 
This challenge is related to ```DMTF```, which stands for ```Dual Tone Multi Frequency```. It is the sounds or tones that are generated by a telephone when numbers are pressed. 

I used an [online DTMF decoding tool](http://www.dialabc.com/) to decode the file.

### Step 3: 
The program analysed the tones and displayed the result in a table, which the tones are specified in numbers from 0-9. 

I listened back the ```wav``` file to group the tones.

### Step 4: 
After I got a bunch of numbers, I would like to convert them to a useful string, which in this case, is the flag. I tried converting the numbers into ASCII characters using a [random online tool](https://onlineasciitools.com/convert-decimal-to-ascii). This gave me the correct flag.

### Step 5: 
This is by far my favourite cryto challenge in CTFlearn. It lets me understand the concept of ```DMTF``` and how it could be used in cryptography.
