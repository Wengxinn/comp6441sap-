# Cryptography

Cryptography in CTF usually involves decoding or decrypting the ciphertext using different techniques. 

## Summary
1. ```Classic ciphers``` 
   - ```Vigenere Cipher```
   - ```Playfair Cipher```
   - ```Polybius Cipher```
2. ```Base64 decode```
3. ```Hex/Binary/ASCII decode```
4. ```XOR```
5. ```Morse code``` - consists of dots and hyphens
6. ```RSA decode``` - decode RSA with extremely large number (usually requires simple python script)
7. ```Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DMTF)``` - decode the tones generated by a telephone when numbers are dialed
8. Tools that are really useful for different types of decryption:
