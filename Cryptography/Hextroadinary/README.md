## Solutions
### Step 1:
I was able to solve this quick because the hint has been given in the question. In order to solve this, we should use XOR. 

Here I used an online [XOR calculator](https://xor.pw/#) and entered the provided values in hexadecimal form (without ```0x```). 

Since the flag should start with 0x, this indicates that the flag should be in hexadecimal form as well. Therefore, the output value (with ```0x``` as prefix) from the XOR function would be the correct answer.

### Flag: 
```0xc0ded```
