## Solutions
### Step 1:
First, I did some lookups to learn about the type of this cryptography. It turns out that this is a ```Polybius Square Cipher```. Since I have never learned the cipher before and the numbers are still manageable, I decided to manually crack the cipher instead of using any online tools. 

### Step 2
I created a quick Polybius Square in ```5x5 crypto.xlsx``` without letter k. 

### Step 3: 
For the first letter, we knew that it was located in the 1st row, 3rd column - ```C```. 

Using the similar technique, I successfully captured the flag!

### Flag: 
```CTF{THUMBS_UP}```
