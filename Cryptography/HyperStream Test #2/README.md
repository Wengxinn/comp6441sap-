## Solutions
### Step 1:
I was kinda confused at first because I haven't seen this kind of ciphers before. 
However, after I searched on [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/), apparently there's a cipher called ```Bacon Cipher``` LOLLLLL... 

I copied-and-pasted the ciphertext to the online tool and guess what? It works! I got the flag!

```ILOUEBACONDONTYOU```

## End Note
YES! I love BACONNNN!
